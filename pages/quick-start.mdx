# Quick Start

Follow the guide below for your specific operating system to get started running a Kuzco worker. Before proceeding, make sure you have compatible [hardware](/hardware).

<WIP />

## macOS

### Desktop App

The easiest way to get started with Kuzco on macOS is to download and install the Kuzco macOS app from the [official website](https://kuzco.xyz/download).

Launch the app and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account and launch a worker.

### CLI

Kuzco can also be run as a CLI tool on macOS. To install Kuzco CLI, run following command in your terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://kuzco.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, [register your account](https://kuzco.xyz/register). Make sure to verify your email to complete the registration process.

Next, run the following command to initialize your Kuzco worker:

```
kuzco init
```

This command will guide you through creating and running a Kuzco worker.

## Windows

### Desktop App

The easiest way to get started with Kuzco on Windows is to download and install the Kuzco Windows app from the [official website](https://kuzco.xyz/download).

Launch the app and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account and launch a worker.

### WSL

Kuzco can also be run on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Check out our [WSL guide](/wsl-setup) to get started.

### Docker

You can run Kuzco in a Docker container on Windows. Make sure you have:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- NVIDIA GPU from our [supported hardware list](/hardware)

Follow these steps:
1. Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Download and install the [NVIDIA Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) for your GPU
3. Install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit for Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)
4. Register a Kuzco account at [https://kuzco.xyz/register](https://kuzco.xyz/register)
5. Verify your email and Discord
6. On the dashboard, navigate to the "Workers" tab on the left
7. Click "Create Worker" in the top right-hand corner
8. Enter a name for your worker, make sure "Docker" is selected, and click "Create Worker"
9. On the Worker Details page, click "Launch Worker" in the top right-hand corner
10. Open PowerShell and run the Docker container with your worker ID and code:
```powershell
docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ${HOME}/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <workerid> --code <code>
```
Note: Each worker has its unique ID and code. Always use the command provided in your Kuzco Console.

Your worker will show as "Initializing" in the dashboard. This process usually takes 1-2 minutes.

## Linux

Run the following command to install Kuzco on Linux:

```
curl -fsSL https://kuzco.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, [register your account](https://kuzco.xyz/register). Make sure to verify your email to complete the registration process.

Next, run the following command to initialize your Kuzco worker:

```
kuzco init
```

This command will guide you through creating and running a Kuzco worker.

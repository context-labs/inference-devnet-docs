# Quick Start

Follow the guide below for your specific operating system to get started running a Kuzco worker. Before proceeding, make sure you have compatible [hardware](/hardware).

<WIP />

## macOS

### Desktop App

The easiest way to get started with Kuzco on macOS is to download and install the Kuzco macOS app from the [official website](https://kuzco.xyz/download).

Launch the app and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account and launch a worker.

### CLI

Kuzco can also be run as a CLI tool on macOS. To install Kuzco CLI, run following command in your terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://kuzco.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, [register your account](https://kuzco.xyz/register). Make sure to verify your email to complete the registration process.

Next, run the following command to initialize your Kuzco worker:

```
kuzco init
```

This command will guide you through creating and running a Kuzco worker.

## Windows

### Desktop App

The easiest way to get started with Kuzco on Windows is to download and install the Kuzco Windows app from the [official website](https://kuzco.xyz/download). This will run natively on your machine but before you can run the app it will ask you for a "Worker ID" and a "Registration Code." To obtain these you will need to use the console which is where you can monitor your workers performance.  

To get started: 

- Navigate to the [official website](https://inference.supply/) and make sure you're logged in.
- Open the console by clicking the "View Console" at the top of the page and navigate to the workers tab
- Click "Create Worker" and select "Windows Desktop" and name your worker
- Click Launch Worker at the top of the page
- Make sure the "Desktop" runtime is highlighted
- Copy and paste the Worker ID and Registration Code into the desktop app
- Start your worker

### WSL

Kuzco can also be run on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Check out our [WSL guide](/wsl-setup) to get started.

### Docker

You can run Kuzco in a Docker container on Windows. Make sure you have:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- NVIDIA GPU from our [supported hardware list](/hardware)

Follow these steps:
1. Register at [kuzco.xyz/register](https://kuzco.xyz/register)
2. Verify your email
3. Go to "Workers" tab in dashboard
4. Click "Create Worker" and select "Docker"
5. Copy the Docker command from the Kuzco Console and run it in your Windows terminal to start the container. The command will look similar to this:

```bash
docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ~/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <unique-worker-id> --code <your-unique-code>
```

Note: Each worker has its unique ID and code. Always use the command provided in your Kuzco Console.

Your worker will show as "Initializing" in the dashboard. This process usually takes 1-2 minutes.

## Linux

Run the following command to install Kuzco on Linux:

```
curl -fsSL https://kuzco.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, [register your account](https://kuzco.xyz/register). Make sure to verify your email to complete the registration process.

Next, run the following command to initialize your Kuzco worker:

```
kuzco init
```

This command will guide you through creating and running a Kuzco worker.

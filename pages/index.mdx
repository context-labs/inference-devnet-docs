# What is Kuzco Testnet?

Kuzco Testnet is a globally distributed network of GPUs that are used to run AI inference tasks for large language models like Llama3, Mistral, and more. Anyone with a GPU that meets the [minimum requirements](/hardware) can join the network and start earning $KZO points. The more GPUs you connect, the more $KZO points you earn.

### What is a Kuzco Testnet Operator?
An operator is a user who connects their GPUs to the Kuzco Testnet. Operators can earn $KZO points by contributing their compute power to the network. Operators are responsible for maintaining their GPUs and ensuring they are running optimally.

### Is Kuzco Testnet stable?
**Kuzco Testnet is currently in its early stages of development.** This means that the network is not yet stable and there will be bugs, and periods of downtime. When there is downtime, we will notify the community on our [Operator Discord](https://discord.gg/kuzco). We are actively working to improve the network, improve stability, and add more features. We are not yet ready for production use, but we are working hard to get there.

### What should I do if there is downtime?
Monitor the [announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/1100110477599723550/1215659199846154261) in the Kuzco Discord for downtime updates from the Kuzco team. 

### What should I do if I have a bug report?
Please [open a ticket](https://discord.com/channels/1100110477599723550/1217137677363707925) in Discord if you have a bug report. Make sure to include all relevant information in order to help us fix the issue. If you do not, your ticket will be closed. Please avoid tagging the team directly outside of support channels. 

### How can I get started?

# Overview

Kuzco is a distributed GPU cluster built on the Solana blockchain, designed to facilitate efficient and cost-effective inference of large language models (LLMs) such as Llama2 and Mistral. By leveraging the power of idle compute resources contributed by network participants, Kuzco enables users to access and utilize these models through an OpenAI-compatible API.

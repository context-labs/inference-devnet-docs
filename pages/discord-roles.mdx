# Kuzco Discord Roles

If you’re new to Kuzco, you might be wondering how to get those special “Worker” roles on our Discord server. Worry not! In this guide, we’ll walk you through the requirements, the process to link your Discord account, and what to do if you get stuck.

## Role Overview

In Kuzco, you can earn different Discord roles based on how many points you accumulate. Each role gives you access to exclusive perks on our server. Here are the current thresholds:

- **Bronze Worker**: 10M points  
- **Silver Worker**: 100M points  
- **Gold Worker**: 1B points  

Once you meet the point requirement for a specific role, Kuzco will automatically assign that role to you on Discord—provided your Discord account is linked.

## Steps to Get Your Role

### 1. Check Your Points
Log in to [the Kuzco dashboard](https://kuzco.xyz/dashboard) to see how many points you currently have. If you haven’t reached the required amount for a role, keep on earning points until you do!

### 2. Link Your Discord Account
1. Go to your [dashboard settings](https://kuzco.xyz/dashboard/settings).  
2. Look for the **Discord Connection** section.  
3. Click **Connect** (or **Login**), then authorize Kuzco to access your Discord account.  

> **Tip:** Make sure you’re connecting the correct Discord account that you use in the Kuzco server.

### 3. Wait for Automatic Assignment
After you’ve successfully linked your Discord, **please allow up to 2 hours** for the role to be assigned automatically.  
- During this period, the system syncs your new point total with Discord.  
- You don’t need to do anything else—just relax and wait!

### 4. Still Don’t See Your Role?
Role assignment generally takes 24-48 hours to process after you've reached the requisite amount of points. If your role hasn’t appeared after 48 hours, head over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kuzco) and open a support ticket. Our team will be happy to look into it and get you sorted out.

## Common Questions

**Q: I earned enough points, but I forgot to link my Discord. Will I still get the role?**  
A: You must link your Discord account in the Kuzco dashboard first. If you earned enough points before linking, don’t worry—once your account is linked, the system will check your total points and update your role accordingly.

**Q: Can I have multiple Worker roles if I surpass multiple thresholds?**  
A: You’ll only see the highest Worker role that matches your points. For example, if you qualify for Silver, you won’t also see Bronze.

# Inference.net Devnet Token Airdrop

Welcome to the Inference.net Devnet Token Airdrop! This guide will walk you through the process of claiming your **$INT devnet tokens**.

<Warning>
  The Inference.net Staking Protocol is being tested on Solana Devnet with test
  tokens. These tokens have no monetary value and should not be used for
  real-world transactions or bought or sold by anyone.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before you can claim your airdrop, you must meet the following requirements:

<Info>
  **Eligibility Requirements**: You must have previously connected and linked a
  Solana wallet to your Inference.net account - Only accounts that linked a
  Solana wallet before the deadline are eligible for the airdrop.
</Info>

<Info>
  **What if I didn't link my wallet in time?**

If you did not link your wallet in time, you are not eligible for the airdrop. Don't worry, we will provide an alternative mechanism for you to acquire tokens and participate in the next phase of
testing.

</Info>

## Setting Up Your Wallet for Devnet

Since this is a test airdrop, you'll need to configure your browser wallet to use **Solana Devnet**.

- **Phantom Wallet:** [instructions](https://docs.phantom.com/developer-powertools/devnet-mode)
- **Solflare Wallet:** [instructions](https://help.solflare.com/en/articles/6328814-differences-between-mainnet-devnet-and-devnet-and-how-to-switch-between-on-solflare)
- **Backpack Wallet:** [instructions](https://blog.sonic.game/solana-devnet-network-setting---backpack)

If you are using a different wallet, or a mobile wallet, please refer to the wallet's documentation for instructions on how to switch to Solana Devnet.

<Warning>
  Solana Devnet is for testing purposes and devnet SOL has no monetary value.
  You can acquire devnet SOL via the [public faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/)
  if you need some.
</Warning>

## After Claiming

Once you've successfully claimed your tokens:

1. **Transaction Receipt**: You'll receive a transaction signature that you can view on the Solana Explorer.
2. **Token Balance**: Check your wallet to see the claimed $INT tokens.
3. **Share**: Share your successful claim on social media using the built-in sharing feature.

<Warning>
  **Important**: The test $INT tokens have no monetary value and will not be
  converted into any future airdrop. We plan to repeat Epoch 3 testing phases
  multiple times and will probably initiate additional airdrops in the future
  with new test tokens.
</Warning>

Delegators participate in the Inference.net network by staking $INT-DEV tokens to operator pools. This helps secure the network while earning a share of epoch rewards without running hardware.

<Warning>
  The staking protocol is being tested on Solana Devnet with test tokens. These
  tokens have no monetary value and should not be used for real-world
  transactions or bought or sold by anyone.
</Warning>

## How Delegation Works

When you delegate tokens to an operator pool:

1. Your tokens help increase the operator's priority for receiving inference jobs
2. You earn a proportional share of the pool's token rewards
3. The operator takes a commission fee from rewards before distribution
4. Your tokens remain yours - operators cannot access delegated tokens

<Note>
  Delegated tokens are not at risk of slashing. Only operator stakes can be
  slashed for poor performance.
</Note>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Solana wallet with:
  - Some SOL for transaction fees
  - $INT-DEV tokens from the airdrop or test faucet
- Basic understanding of staking and delegation

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

<Warning>
  **Important**: Before continuing you must ensure your Solana wallet is set to
  use Solana Devnet. Please see the [Wallet
  Setup](/devnet-epoch-3/airdrop/#setting-up-your-wallet-for-devnet) guide for
  more information.
</Warning>

1. Visit [stake.devnet.inference.net](https://stake.devnet.inference.net)
2. Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right
3. Select your wallet provider and approve the connection

### Step 2: Browse Operator Pools

Navigate to the **Operators** page to view all available pools. Key metrics to consider:

**Pool Performance:**

- **Rank**: Position by total stake (higher rank = more jobs)
- **Total Stake**: Combined operator and delegator tokens
- **Operator Stake**: Operator's self-stake percentage

**Economic Terms:**

- **Commission Rate**: Percentage of rewards kept by operator
- **Delegation Allowed**: Whether the pool accepts external stake
- **Auto Stake Fees**: If commission is automatically compounded

### Step 3: Evaluate Operators

Consider these factors when choosing an operator:

1. **Stake Ratio**: Operators must maintain ≥10% of total pool stake
2. **Commission Rate**: Lower rates mean higher delegator rewards
3. **Track Record**: View historical performance in the operator details
4. **Hardware**: GPUs with higher VRAM typically process more jobs
5. **Communication**: Active operators often have websites or community presence

<Tip>
  Click on any operator to view detailed statistics, historical performance, and
  pool configuration.
</Tip>

## Staking Process

### Delegating Tokens

1. Click on your chosen operator pool
2. Click the **Stake** button
3. Enter the amount of $INT-DEV to delegate
4. Review the transaction details:
   - Amount to stake
   - Current pool commission
   - Estimated share of pool
5. Click **Confirm Stake**
6. Approve the transaction in your wallet

<Info>
  You can stake to multiple operator pools to diversify your delegation
  strategy.
</Info>

### Monitoring Your Stake

View your delegations in two places:

**My Operators Tab:**

- Shows all pools where you have active stake
- Displays your stake amount and current value
- Shows pending unstaking amounts

**Individual Pool Pages:**

- Your specific stake in that pool
- Accumulated rewards
- Share percentage of the pool

## Managing Delegations

### Adding More Stake

You can increase your delegation at any time:

1. Navigate to the operator pool
2. Click **Stake**
3. Add the additional amount
4. Confirm the transaction

### Unstaking Process

Unstaking requires a cooldown period:

1. Click **Unstake** on the operator's page
2. Enter the amount to unstake (partial or full)
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Wait for the cooldown period to complete
5. Click **Withdraw** to claim your tokens

<Warning>
  When unstaking tokens, if you unstake more tokens while you have existing
  tokens in cooldown, the cooldown timer will reset for all of the unstaking
  tokens.
</Warning>

### Claiming Rewards

Rewards are distributed automatically during the unstaking process. When you unstake and withdraw:

- Your original stake is returned
- Accumulated rewards are included
- No separate claim transaction is needed

## Choosing Operators Wisely

### Green Flags

- ✅ Consistent uptime and performance
- ✅ Reasonable commission rates (10-30%)
- ✅ Strong operator stake ratio (well above 10%)
- ✅ Active community engagement
- ✅ Professional setup with multiple GPUs

### Red Flags

- ❌ Operator stake near minimum (exactly 10%)
- ❌ Very high commission rates (>50%)
- ❌ Pool marked as "Halted"
- ❌ No website or contact information
- ❌ Frequent configuration changes

## Risk Considerations

While delegation is generally safe, consider:

1. **Opportunity Cost**: Tokens are locked during staking and cooldown
2. **Variable Returns**: Rewards depend on operator performance
3. **Commission Changes**: Operators can adjust rates (effective next epoch)
4. **Pool Closure**: Operators may close pools, stopping rewards for all delegators

<Note>
  Remember: $INT-DEV tokens are testnet tokens with no monetary value. They
  exist purely for testing the protocol mechanics.
</Note>

## Maximizing Returns

**Strategies for Delegators:**

1. **Diversify**: Spread stake across multiple high-performing operators
2. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check operator metrics and adjust
3. **Consider Pool Size**: Smaller pools may offer growth potential
4. **Watch Commission**: Lower isn't always better - consider operator quality
5. **Stay Informed**: Follow operator updates and network announcements

## FAQ

**Q: Can I lose my delegated tokens?**<br/>
A: No, delegated tokens cannot be slashed. Only operator self-stake is at risk.

**Q: How often are rewards distributed?**<br/>
A: Token rewards accumulate continuously and are claimed when you unstake.

**Q: Can I delegate to multiple pools?**<br/>
A: Yes, you can delegate to as many pools as you wish.

**Q: What happens if an operator closes their pool?**<br/>
A: You will stop earnings and you will need to unstake your tokens.

**Q: How long is the unstaking cooldown?**<br/>
A: Delegators have a shorter cooldown than operators (specific duration varies by network configuration).

## Understanding Pool Shares

<Info>
  Inference.net uses a share-based accounting system to fairly distribute
  rewards. When you stake tokens, you receive shares that represent your
  proportion of the pool.
</Info>

### How Shares Work

When you stake tokens to a pool, you don't just hold tokens - you receive **shares** that represent your ownership percentage of the pool. This system allows rewards to be distributed fairly without complex calculations for each delegator.

**The key formulas:**

- When staking: `shares = (your tokens / total pool tokens) × total shares`
- When unstaking: `tokens = (your shares / total shares) × total pool tokens`

### Why Your Unstake Amount May Differ

Due to how share calculations work with integer math, you might notice small differences between what you stake and what you can immediately unstake. This is normal and expected.

<Warning>
  **Precision Rounding Example:** If you stake 100 tokens to a pool that has
  already received rewards, you might only be able to unstake 99 tokens
  immediately. This happens because:
  <ul>
    <li>The pool's share-to-token ratio is no longer 1:1 after rewards</li>
    <li>Integer division during share calculation rounds down</li>
    <li>The "dust" (fractional tokens) remains in the pool</li>
  </ul>
  This is not a loss - it's how the protocol ensures fair reward distribution.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Remember our token will have standard 9 decimal place precision, so in reality
  any precision lost when initial staking occurs at very small fractions of a
  token, e.g. 0.000001 tokens.
</Note>

### Practical Example

Let's walk through a scenario:

**Initial State:**

- Pool has 1,000 tokens and 1,000 shares (1:1 ratio)
- Pool receives 100 token rewards
- Now: 1,100 tokens, 1,000 shares (1.1:1 ratio)

**You stake 100 tokens:**

- Your shares = (100 / 1,100) × 1,000 = 90.90... = 90 shares (rounded down)
- Pool now has: 1,200 tokens, 1,090 shares

**If you immediately unstake all shares:**

- Your tokens = (90 / 1,090) × 1,200 = 99.08... = 99 tokens (rounded down)
- The 1 token difference remains in the pool

<Note>
  This rounding effect is minimal and only affects immediate unstaking. As you
  earn rewards over time, your share value increases, typically offsetting any
  initial rounding.
</Note>

### Best Practices

1. **Don't worry about small differences** - This is normal protocol behavior
2. **Hold for rewards** - The longer you stake, the more your shares appreciate
3. **Stake larger amounts** - Larger stakes minimize the relative impact of rounding
4. **Consider it a contribution** - The dust helps maintain pool health

### The Bigger Picture

This share system enables:

- ✅ Fair reward distribution to all delegators
- ✅ Automatic compounding of rewards
- ✅ Efficient on-chain calculations
- ✅ Protection against gaming the system

The tiny amounts lost to rounding are negligible compared to the rewards earned from staking over time.

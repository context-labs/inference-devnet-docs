Delegators participate in the Inference.net network by staking $INT-DEV tokens to operator pools. This helps secure the network while earning a share of epoch rewards without running hardware.

<Warning>
  The Inference.net Staking Protocol is being tested on Solana Devnet with test
  tokens. These tokens have no monetary value and should not be used for
  real-world transactions or bought or sold by anyone.
</Warning>

## How Delegation Works

When you delegate tokens to an operator pool:

1. Your tokens help increase the operator's priority for receiving inference jobs
2. You earn a proportional share of the pool's token rewards
3. You earn a proportional share of the pool's USDC revenue (if operator enables revenue sharing)
4. The operator takes commission fees from both rewards and USDC before distribution
5. Your tokens remain yours - operators cannot access delegated tokens

<Note>
  Delegated tokens are not at risk of slashing. Only operator stakes can be
  slashed for poor performance.
</Note>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Solana wallet with:
  - Some SOL for transaction fees
  - $INT-DEV tokens from the airdrop or test faucet
- Basic understanding of staking and delegation

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

<Warning>
  **Important**: Before continuing you must ensure your Solana wallet is set to
  use Solana Devnet. Please see the [Wallet
  Setup](/devnet-epoch-3/airdrop/#setting-up-your-wallet-for-devnet) guide for
  more information.
</Warning>

1. Visit [stake.devnet.inference.net](https://stake.devnet.inference.net)
2. Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right
3. Select your wallet provider and approve the connection

### Step 2: Browse Operator Pools

Navigate to the **Operators** page to view all available pools. Key metrics to consider:

**Pool Performance:**

- **Rank**: Position by total stake (higher rank = more jobs)
- **Total Stake**: Combined operator and delegator tokens
- **Operator Stake**: Operator's self-stake percentage

**Economic Terms:**

- **Reward Commission Rate**: Percentage of token rewards kept by operator
- **USDC Commission Rate**: Percentage of USDC revenue kept by operator
- **Delegation Allowed**: Whether the pool accepts external stake
- **Auto Stake Fees**: If commission is automatically compounded

### Step 3: Evaluate Operators

Consider these factors when choosing an operator:

1. **Stake Ratio**: Operators must maintain their minimum stake amount
2. **Commission Rates**: Lower rates mean higher delegator rewards (check both token and USDC rates)
3. **Track Record**: View historical performance in the operator details
4. **Hardware**: GPUs with higher VRAM typically process more jobs
5. **Communication**: Active operators often have websites or community presence

<Tip>
  Click on any operator to view detailed statistics, historical performance, and
  pool configuration.
</Tip>

## Staking Process

### Delegating Tokens

1. Click on your chosen operator pool
2. Click the **Stake** button
3. Enter the amount of $INT-DEV to delegate
4. Review the transaction details:
   - Amount to stake
   - Current pool commission
   - Estimated share of pool
5. Click **Confirm Stake**
6. Approve the transaction in your wallet

<Info>
  You can stake to multiple operator pools to diversify your delegation
  strategy.
</Info>

### Monitoring Your Stake

View your delegations in two places:

**My Operators Tab:**

- Shows all pools where you have active stake
- Displays your stake amount and current value
- Shows pending unstaking amounts
- Displays accrued USDC earnings

**Individual Pool Pages:**

- Your specific stake in that pool
- Accumulated token rewards
- Accumulated USDC earnings
- Share percentage of the pool

## Managing Delegations

### Adding More Stake

You can increase your delegation at any time:

1. Navigate to the operator pool
2. Click **Stake**
3. Add the additional amount
4. Confirm the transaction

### Unstaking Process

Unstaking requires a cooldown period:

1. Click **Unstake** on the operator's page
2. Enter the amount to unstake (partial or full)
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Wait for the cooldown period to complete
5. Click **Withdraw** to claim your tokens

<Warning>
  When unstaking tokens, if you unstake more tokens while you have existing
  tokens in cooldown, the cooldown timer will reset for all of the unstaking
  tokens.
</Warning>

### Claiming Rewards

Token rewards are distributed automatically during the unstaking process. When you unstake and withdraw:

- Your original stake is returned
- Accumulated token rewards are included
- No separate claim transaction is needed

### Withdrawing USDC Earnings

USDC earnings can be withdrawn at any time without affecting your stake:

1. Navigate to the operator pool on the staking dashboard
2. Click **Withdraw USDC**
3. Confirm the transaction to receive your USDC earnings

<Note>
  USDC withdrawals do not affect your stake or future earning potential. You can
  withdraw USDC as often as you like.
</Note>

## Choosing Operators Wisely

### Green Flags

- ✅ Consistent uptime and performance
- ✅ Reasonable commission rates (10-30%)
- ✅ Strong operator stake ratio (well above 10%)
- ✅ Active community engagement
- ✅ Professional setup with multiple GPUs

### Red Flags

- ❌ Operator stake near minimum (exactly at minimum threshold)
- ❌ Very high commission rates (>50% for tokens or USDC)
- ❌ Pool marked as "Halted"
- ❌ No website or contact information
- ❌ Frequent configuration changes

## Risk Considerations

While delegation is generally safe, consider:

1. **Opportunity Cost**: Tokens are locked during staking and cooldown
2. **Variable Returns**: Rewards depend on operator performance
3. **Commission Changes**: Operators can adjust rates (effective next epoch)
4. **Pool Closure**: Operators may close pools, stopping rewards and USDC earnings
5. **USDC Revenue Variability**: USDC earnings depend on inference job volume

<Note>
  Remember: $INT-DEV tokens are testnet tokens with no monetary value. They
  exist purely for testing the protocol mechanics.
</Note>

## Maximizing Returns

**Strategies for Delegators:**

1. **Diversify**: Spread stake across multiple high-performing operators
2. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check operator metrics and adjust
3. **Consider Pool Size**: Smaller pools may offer growth potential
4. **Watch Commissions**: Compare both token and USDC commission rates
5. **Stay Informed**: Follow operator updates and network announcements
6. **Withdraw USDC Regularly**: Claim your USDC earnings periodically

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I earn USDC as a delegator?**<br/>
A: When operators process inference jobs, they earn USDC. If they've enabled USDC revenue sharing (by setting a commission rate less than 100%), you'll earn a proportional share based on your stake in the pool.

**Q: When can I withdraw my USDC earnings?**<br/>
A: You can withdraw accrued USDC at any time without affecting your stake or unstaking your tokens.

**Q: Do all operators share USDC revenue?**<br/>
A: No. Operators can choose their USDC commission rate. A 100% rate means no sharing, while lower rates mean more USDC for delegators.

**Q: How are USDC earnings calculated?**<br/>
A: Your share of USDC equals: (Your stake / Total pool stake) × USDC revenue × (1 - USDC commission rate)

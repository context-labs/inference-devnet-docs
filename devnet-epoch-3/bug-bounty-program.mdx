title: "Bug Bounty Program"
description: "This program covers vulnerabilities in Inference.net's Solana smart contracts, inference system, and supporting infrastructure. Rewards are paid in USD based on severity and impact."
---

## Scope

The following components are in scope for this bug bounty program:

**Solana Smart Contracts:**

- Staking protocol contract
- Airdrop program contract
- Delegation and reward distribution logic

**Inference System:**

- Node software and auto-update mechanisms
- GPU detection and validation systems
- Job routing and distribution logic
- Inference engine management
- API endpoints and authentication

**Infrastructure:**

- Dashboard and web applications
- Wallet integration points
- Off-chain reward calculation systems

<Warning>
  Out of Scope: Third-party services, social engineering attacks, and issues
  already known or being addressed.
</Warning>

## Vulnerability Category Overview

| Severity                  | USD Payout Range    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Critical                  | \$10,000 - \$50,000 |
| High                      | \$2,500 - \$10,000  |
| Medium                    | \$500 - \$2,500     |
| Low                       | \$100 - \$500       |
| Inference System Exploits | \$1,000 - \$25,000  |

### Critical Severity

Vulnerabilities that could result in:

- Direct theft of operator or delegator funds
- Unauthorized minting or burning of tokens
- Compromise of any on-chain vaults
- Compromise of any system private keys
- Arbitrary code execution on node infrastructure
- Complete bypass of inference job authentication

### High Severity

Vulnerabilities that could result in:

- Temporary freezing of user funds
- Manipulation of reward calculations affecting multiple users
- Unauthorized access to operator pools
- Significant disruption of the inference network
- Bypass of stake-weighted routing logic

### Medium Severity

Vulnerabilities that could result in:

- Limited impact on individual users
- Minor reward calculation errors
- Temporary service disruptions
- Information disclosure of non-sensitive data
- Bypass of rate limiting or spam protections

### Low Severity

Vulnerabilities that could result in:

- UI/UX issues with security implications
- Minor information leaks
- Best practice violations without direct impact
- Issues requiring significant user interaction

## Inference System Exploits

We're particularly interested in vulnerabilities related to the integrity of our inference system:

- Faking completed inference requests to earn rewards without processing
- Manipulating job routing to receive disproportionate rewards
- Bypassing GPU validation to register unsupported hardware
- Exploiting the unified inference engine selection logic

<Note>
  Rewards for inference system exploits scale with the potential economic impact
  and the number of affected operators or users.

## Submission Process

### How to Report

1. **Prepare Your Report** (see template below) - Include:

   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Step-by-step reproduction instructions
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fixes (if applicable)

2. **Submit Securely**:

   - Email: security@inference.net
   - DO NOT disclose publicly before resolution

3. **Wait for Acknowledgment**:
   - Initial response within 48 hours
   - Severity assessment within 7 days
   - Resolution timeline provided based on severity

### Report Template

```markdown
## Vulnerability Report

**Reporter:** [Your name/handle]
**Date:** [Submission date]
**Severity Assessment:** [Your assessment]

### Summary

[Brief description of the vulnerability]

### Details

[Technical details and root cause]

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [...]

### Impact

[Potential damage if exploited]

### Proof of Concept

[Code or demonstration if applicable]

### Suggested Fix

[Your recommendations]
```

## Rules and Guidelines

### Responsible Disclosure

- **DO NOT** exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof of concept
- **DO NOT** perform attacks that could harm users or the network
- **DO NOT** publicly disclose before we've had time to fix the issue
- **DO** report vulnerabilities promptly upon discovery
- **DO** provide sufficient detail for reproduction

## Review Process

### Severity Assessment

Our security team evaluates submissions based on:

1. **Exploitability**: How difficult is the attack to execute?
2. **Impact**: What damage could be caused?
3. **Likelihood**: How probable is real-world exploitation?
4. **Novelty**: Is this a new discovery or known issue?

### Bounty Calculation

Final rewards consider:

- Severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Quality of the report and reproduction steps
- Suggested fixes and mitigation strategies
- Responsible disclosure adherence
- First reporter (in case of duplicates)

<Info>
  Rewards are at the discretion of the Inference.net security team. We aim to be
  fair and competitive with industry standards.

## Contact

Please submit all reports or questions to security@inference.net.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I test on the mainnet when it launches?**<br />
A: No, all testing must be performed on Devnet only. Mainnet testing is
strictly prohibited.

**Q: Can I submit multiple vulnerabilities in one report?**<br />
A: Please submit separate reports for distinct vulnerabilities to ensure
proper tracking.

**Q: What if my vulnerability is marked as duplicate?**<br />
A: The first reporter receives the full reward. Subsequent reporters may
receive a smaller acknowledgment reward.

**Q: How do you handle partial vulnerabilities?**<br />
A: We reward based on the furthest point of exploitation demonstrated, even if
not fully weaponized.

## Updates and Changes

This bug bounty program may be updated as our system evolves:

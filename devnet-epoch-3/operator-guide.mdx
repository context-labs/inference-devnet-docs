Operators run GPU hardware on the Inference.net network to process AI inference jobs. By creating an operator pool and staking $INT-DEV tokens, you increase your chances of receiving jobs and earning rewards.

<Warning>
  The Inference.net Staking Protocol is being tested on Solana Devnet with test
  tokens. These tokens have no monetary value and should not be used for
  real-world transactions or bought or sold by anyone.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your operator pool:

1. Ensure you have a funded Solana wallet with:
   - Some SOL for transaction fees
   - $INT-DEV tokens for the registration fee and initial stake
2. Link your Solana wallet to your Inference.net account
3. Have your GPU node running and connected to the network

<Note>Each wallet can create only one operator pool.</Note>

## Creating Your Operator Pool

An operator pool is your on-chain identity that manages stake, receives job allocations, and distributes rewards.

<Warning>
  **Important**: Before continuing you must ensure your Solana wallet is set to
  use Solana Devnet. Please see the [Wallet
  Setup](/devnet-epoch-3/airdrop/#setting-up-your-wallet-for-devnet) guide for
  more information.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Link Your Wallet

1. Navigate to the [Dashboard Wallets Page](https://devnet.inference.net/dashboard/wallets)
2. Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right
3. Select your Solana wallet provider and approve the connection
4. Link your wallet to your account

<Note>
  To create an operator pool, you must have a Solana wallet linked to your
  account. This wallet will be the admin wallet for your operator pool.
</Note>

### Step 2: Create Operator Pool

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Staking → Overview**
2. Click **Create Operator Pool**
3. Review the registration fee requirement (paid in $INT-DEV tokens)
4. Follow the steps to create your operator pool:

   **Economic Settings:**

   - **Token Commission Rate**: Percentage of token rewards you keep (0-100%)
   - **USDC Commission Rate**: Percentage of USDC revenue you keep (0-100%)
   - **Allow Delegation**: Whether to accept stake from other token holders
   - **Auto Stake Fees**: Automatically compound commission into your stake

   **Payout Settings:**

   - **USDC Payout Wallet**: Where to receive USDC commission and your share of revenue

   **Profile Information:**

   - **Organization Name**: Your operator pool's display name
   - **Website URL**: Optional link to your website
   - **Description**: Brief description of your operation

5. Review your settings and the registration fee
6. Click **Create Pool** and approve the transaction in your wallet

<Warning>
  Pool creation requires: - A registration fee in $INT-DEV tokens
  (non-refundable) - Sufficient SOL for transaction fees - This wallet has not
  created a pool before
</Warning>

### Step 3: Stake Your Pool

Operators must stake a minimum amount (set globally by the protocol) before their pool can accept delegations. This ensures proper economic alignment.

1. On your pool overview page, click **Stake**
2. Enter at least the minimum required amount of $INT-DEV
3. Review the transaction and click **Confirm Stake**
4. Approve the transaction in your wallet

<Info>
  Until you meet the minimum stake requirement, your pool cannot accept
  delegations from other users. The more you stake beyond the minimum, the
  higher your priority for receiving inference jobs.
</Info>

## Managing Your Pool

### Monitoring Performance

Your operator dashboard displays key metrics:

- **Total Pool Stake**: Combined operator and delegator stake
- **Operator Stake**: Your personal stake (must remain above minimum)
- **Token Commission Earned**: Accumulated fees from token rewards
- **USDC Commission Earned**: Accumulated fees from USDC revenue
- **USDC Revenue Share**: Your proportional share of USDC revenue
- **Total Delegators**: Number of external stakers

### Adjusting Settings

You can modify certain pool parameters after creation:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Staking → Settings**
2. Update available settings:
   - Token commission rate (changes apply next epoch when rewards are claimed for your pool)
   - USDC commission rate (changes apply next epoch when rewards are claimed for your pool)
   - Allow/disallow delegations
   - Auto-stake preferences
   - Profile information
   - USDC payout destination

<Note>
  Setting USDC commission below 100% enables revenue sharing with delegators,
  which can attract more stake to your pool.
</Note>

### Withdrawing Rewards

**Commission Fees (Token & USDC):**

- Both token and USDC commissions accrue on-chain
- Click **Withdraw Token Commission** or **Withdraw USDC Commission**
- Commissions are sent to your designated wallets

**USDC Revenue Share:**

- As an operator, you also earn a proportional share of USDC revenue
- This is separate from your commission and based on your stake in the pool
- Click **Withdraw USDC Earnings** to claim your revenue share

**Unstaking Process:**

1. Click **Unstake** on your pool overview
2. Enter the amount to unstake
3. Wait for the cooldown period (varies for operators vs delegators)
4. Click **Withdraw** once the cooldown expires

<Note>
  Operators have a longer unstaking cooldown than delegators to ensure network
  stability.
</Note>

### Advanced Management

**Emergency Actions:**

- **Change Admin**: Transfer pool ownership to a new wallet
- **Change Staking Record**: Update the operator stake wallet if compromised
- **Close Pool**: Permanently close your operator pool (irreversible)

## Best Practices

1. **Meet Minimum Requirements**: Ensure you maintain stake above the global minimum to keep accepting delegations
2. **Set Competitive Commissions**: Balance earning potential with attractiveness to delegators for both token and USDC rates
3. **Consider Revenue Sharing**: Lower USDC commission rates can attract more delegators
4. **Monitor Hardware**: Ensure your GPUs maintain high uptime for better reputation scores
5. **Engage Delegators**: Provide clear communication about your operation and performance

## Troubleshooting

**GPU Not Detected:**

- Ensure latest GPU drivers are installed
- Verify node has proper system permissions
- Check that your GPU model is supported

**Cannot Create Pool:**

- Verify wallet has sufficient $INT-DEV for registration fee
- Ensure wallet has sufficient SOL for transaction fees
- Check that this wallet hasn't already created a pool
- Ensure wallet is properly linked to your account
- Verify pool creation is currently enabled

**Cannot Accept Delegations:**

- Ensure you've staked at least the minimum required amount
- Check that delegations are enabled in your pool settings
- Verify your pool is not halted

**Stake Transaction Fails:**

- Confirm sufficient $INT-DEV token balance
- Ensure you're not violating minimum stake requirements
- Try refreshing and reconnecting your wallet
